# KDTrees-using-quicksort
An attempt to loosely combine the code for quicksort with the code for binary space partitioning using k-d trees to find the nearest neighbor in a given set of 3-dimensional points in roughly O(3n^(2/3)) time (Cite/Peer review 1 Worst-case analysis for region and partial region searches in multidimensional binary search trees and balanced quad trees by D. T. Lee & C. K. Wong on Springer Link to see why it's strictly sublinear for all dimensions.) with the idea being that they share the same (HTML/JS) algorithmic codebase and that both are used (in addition to other techniques such as ray tracing and marching cube rendering) as the basis for modern 3 game engines like Unity or Unreal engine 5.

Included algorithms :

    - Quicksort
    - Quickselect
    - K-D tree construction
    - K-D nearest neighbor
    - Median of medians
    - Dutch national flag partitioning
